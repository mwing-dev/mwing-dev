I'm interested in web development, Blazor projects, and creating robust backend solutions.

I'm currently learning more about hybrid applications using Blazor and integrating third-party APIs.

I'm looking to collaborate on open-source Blazor projects and anything involving C# and .NET.

Fun fact: I love experimenting with tech gadgets, and I'm currently exploring GPIO control using a Raspberry Pi Pico!
