## About Me

I work primarily with **hardware and infrastructure**, and I write **software** when it makes systems easier to manage, automate, or explain to future-me.
Most of my development work lives in the **.NET ecosystem**, with a focus on **Blazor** and backend tooling that exists to reduce repetition and remove manual steps.

## Interests

* Hardware-first systems and infrastructure
* Blazor Server, and hybrid apps
* PowerShell and .NET for automation, depending on how permanent the problem is
* APIs and backend services that support real systems
* Small hardware projects that benefit from just enough code

## Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on:

* Open-source **Blazor** or **.NET** projects
* Internal tools and automation platforms
* Anything that bridges **hardware, infrastructure, and software**
* Projects that make repetitive tasks disappear
